## Lento≈æ Architecture Libraries

This sub-directory have the user interface information, smart contracts, and policy specifications.

### User Interface

The user interface will be all interface changes based on future improvements. Contributors can follow the template to introduce new user interfaces based on the template for implementers use. Implementers must consider that this repositroy is for **informational purposes** before implementing a compononet. 

While some components may have code implementations included, some configuration, modules, or other critical components needed to run user interface implementations.
**The process of making implementation to inform missing information, is work in progress.**

### Contracts

Smart contract implementation and other policy related informational is located in the contracts sub-directory. Contributors can introduce new policies with specifications by creating a pull request.

**The process for reviewing pull request is work in progress**
